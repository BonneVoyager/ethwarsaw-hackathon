A healthy community can help a traditional business develop a better product based on feedback, add more features based on the community's needs, and organically onboard more people. For the first time in history, general users have the power to affect the brands' next step. There is ‚Äúwe‚Äù in web 3 for all of these reasons. I would like to dive deeper into 3 factors of community development (connectedness, co-creation, credentials), highlight the ways traditional businesses can build a community in web3 (DAOs, IRL events), and some recent examples (Lacoste, Tag Heuer, KPMG, Adidas)."

In the talk, I cover 5 core pillars or organization design: leadership, product, monetization, communication and resiliency, discussing them from the perspective of a DAO. I then go through the enablers of successful DAO design, i.e. processes, people and tools. The final objective is to provide listeners with a framework to decentralize in a structured and controlled way, preserving the objectives, principles, values and culture of the initial project."

Snaps uses brand new tech called Secure EcmaScript, that allows us to completely confine external JavaScript, so that it can do only what we allow it to do. This talk is a deep-level technological insight into how Secure EcmaScript works behind the scenes, how you can write your own from ground up and what it takes to provide access to external resources without privilege escalation. We're going to be abusing JavaScript pretty strongly - medium to high JavaScript knowledge will be helpful."

We have only just scratched the surface of automation's potential in DeFi , from user-friendly trading strategies to infrastructure-level liquidation protection. The next step is being able to integrate off-chain data into smart contract automation, enabling projects to automatically trigger actions when specified real-world conditions are met. Gelato Network is Web3's premier automation network, enabling developers to automate a wide variety of arbitrary smart contract executions on and across all EVM-compatible blockchains. Examples of use cases developers have built on top of Gelato include Limit Orders on AMMs like Uniswap, automatic compounding of yield farming vaults, Aave liquidation protection, MakerDAO debt ceiling updates, automated liquidity management, and even the petting of Aavegotchis."
